<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://ee.stanford.edu/">Electrical Engineering 
department</a> at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/Stanford">University</a>.
I am working with <a href="http://csl.stanford.edu/~pal/">Prof. Philip Levis</a>,
and am a part of the <a href="http://sing.stanford.edu/site">SING lab</a>.
I received my M.S. from Stanford in 2014.
Before that, I completed my undergrad from
<a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>, in 2011.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<h3>Distributed AMR Simulations</h3>
<p>Adaptive mesh refinement provides the ability to refine and coarsen simulation
domains, to focus computational resources in regions of interest. For a
large water simulation, this may be the surface, with ripples and splashes,
and regions with turbulence and vorticities. Dynamic tree-based structures
such as octrees and <a href="http://www.openvdb.org/">OpenVDB</a> provide data-structures
that can adapt dynamically. Distributing such simulations efficiently is
challenging, because of the complexity of managing neighbors, boundary data
and communication between neighboring partitions, and load imbalance.
I am currently researching a software stack and techniques to address these
issues.</p>
<h3><a href="http://ebblang.org">Ebb DSL For Physical Simulations</a></h3>
<p>Ebb is a language for writing performance portable physical simulations &ndash;
Ebb programs can run efficiently on CPUs and GPUs.
Ebb supports a variety of domains such as grids, particles, triangular meshes
and tetrahedral meshes. It uses a relational data model, that is flexible
enough to capture these domains, and abstract and informative enough to
parallelize the code correctly. For more details, demos and tutorials on Ebb,
check out <a href="http://ebblang.org/">this page</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://nimbus.stanford.edu">Fast Cloud Computing with Nimbus</a></h3>
<p>Nimbus is an asynchronous many task based framework, for running computations
in the cloud. It automatically schedules and load-balances computations across
nodes, and provides fault-tolerance.
Execution templates allows Nimbus to run tasks at rates a magnitude higher
than Spark, while keeping the flexibility of dynamic scheduling.
More information about Nimbus is available <a href="http://nimbus.stanford.edu/">here</a>.
We have implemented several applications and a physical simulation with Nimbus.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3><a href="files/contextual-code-completion.pdf">Contextual Code Completion Using Machine Learning</a></h3>
<p>Large projects such as kernels, drivers and libraries follow a code
style, and have recurring patterns. In this project, we explored
learning based code recommendation, to use project context
to give meaningful suggestions. Using word vectors to model
code tokens, and neural network based learning techniques, we
were able to capture interesting patterns, and predict code that
cannot be predicted by a simple grammar and syntax based approach
as in conventional IDEs. We achieved a total prediction
accuracy of 56.0% on Linux kernel, a C project, and 40.6% on
Twisted, a Python networking library.
The complete project report is available
<a href="files/contextual-code-completion.pdf">here</a> and the code is on github
<a href="https://github.com/subhasis256/ml_code_completion">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com/2015/05/31/cs244-15-codel-controlling-delay-in-queues/">Reproducing CoDel with Mahimahi</a></h3>
<p>Droptail queuing is a simple way of managing queues where internet switches
buffer packets till their internal memory is full, and ignore and drop packets
that arrive once their memory is full. While simple, droptail can perform
poorly in practice. With memories becoming cheap, and buffers becoming large,
it can cause large packet delays for latency sensitive applications.
Active queue management techniques drop packets even before the buffer is
completely full. CoDel is a famous AQM algorithm, that drops packets that
stay in the queue above a target for a period of time.
In this project, we emulated CoDel with Mahimahi, to reproduce the
<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2209336">original results</a>,
and we also evaluated CoDel's performance with faster varying bandwidths,
using a 4G trace.
More details about the implementation and results are
<a href="https://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com/2015/05/31/cs244-15-codel-controlling-delay-in-queues/">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="files/load-balancing-cs344c.pdf">Load Balancing PhysBAM on Multi-Core Machines</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://physbam.stanford.edu/">PhysBAM</a> is a physics based simulation library
capable of simulating various phenomenon like compressible and incompressible
fluids, rigid and deformable solids, coupled fluids and solids, fracture and
fire.
Parallelizing a simulation by creating a separate process per partition
on a single node can result in skewed work load across processors.
For example, one process may be in charge of regions that contain mostly air,
resulting in little actual work.
Over-partitioning can solve this problem, but can result in large amount of
on chip communication.
Also, over-partitioning does not work well for linear solves as in projection,
to enforce compressibility.
In this project, we used thread queues to divide work more evenly, with
less overhead.
For stages like projection, which do not perform well with excessive
sub-division, we used fewer threads to operate on the same data.
For stages like advection, we added guards to check for water, avoiding
wasteful work.
More details about the project and results are available
<a href="files/load-balancing-cs344c.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="files/DMT-relays.pdf">Diversity Multiplexing Trade-off for Full Duplex Relay Networks</a> </h3>
<p>Co-operative communication with relay assistance helps in enhancing the
capacity of point to point links.
Presence of multiple relays provides multiple paths from the source to the
destination.
With no channel state information at the transmitter, these paths can be used
to either obtain a high communication rate or a low probability of error.
We can trade off one of these quantities for the other.
In this project, I derived a lower bound on the error probability at the
destination as a function of the communication rate, assuming a finite time
for communication. More details and derivations are in the project report
<a href="files/DMT-relays.pdf">here</a>.</p>
